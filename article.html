            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-4">Mental Health Benefits of Exercise</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Exercise has profound effects on mental health. Studies show that physical activity can reduce symptoms of
                anxiety, depression, and stress. It boosts the production of endorphins, which are the body's natural mood
                elevators.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-2">How Exercise Reduces Stress</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Engaging in physical activity helps to reduce levels of cortisol, the body's primary stress hormone.
                When you exercise, your body becomes more resilient to stress, and you can handle stressful situations with
                greater ease.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-2">Exercise and Brain Function</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Exercise also helps to improve cognitive function. Regular physical activity promotes the growth of new
                brain cells, especially in the hippocampus, which is responsible for memory and learning.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-700 mb-4">How Exercise Improves Physical Health</h2>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Regular exercise has a direct impact on physical health by improving cardiovascular health, increasing
                strength, and promoting better flexibility and mobility. It reduces the risk of chronic diseases such as
                heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-2">Cardiovascular Health</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Regular exercise helps to lower blood pressure, improve circulation, and reduce cholesterol levels, which
                are all essential factors for maintaining a healthy heart.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-500 mb-2">Building Strength and Flexibility</h3>
            <p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Weight-bearing exercises like walking, running, and strength training increase bone density and muscle
                strength, reducing the risk of osteoporosis and frailty as we age.
